# Space Invaders
This Space Invaders is an attempt to recreate gameplay similar to the Space Invaders arcade game.
You play as a green ship.  Press Space to fire. Left/Right arrows and A/D are used for movement.
The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible while staying alive! You lose a life for every invader that gets through to earth!
